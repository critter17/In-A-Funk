  storyText: "The creepy bartender falls flat on his face. As the bartender rolls
    over dazed and confused wondering where he was, you notice a small pin that has
    broken into even smaller pieces with electrical components inside. Aha! The pins
    are mind controlling everyone. What do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Take off and destroy
    everyone's pins with the bartender's help\r\n\r\n2. Curse at the bartender for
    being a creepy dude and to never show up at The Funky Chicken again, and destroy
    the pins yourself"
