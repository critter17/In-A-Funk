  storyText: "The bartender stands up completely baffled and storms off cursing under
    his breath. You take everyone's pins off and destroy them. It's now that you come
    face to face with the dancer abductors... Aliens. They look just like how they're
    described in the tabloids, which was surprising. They don't look intimidating
    at all, in fact they look rather cute. However, they did kidnap your dancers at
    the hottest club in town.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Strangle them all to
    death\r\n\r\n2. Help them find their groove"
