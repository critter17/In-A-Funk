  storyText: "DJ Max looks around the dance floor and you recognize everyone here.
    You found them! Then you saw him... The creepy bartender. Some thing looked off
    though. His dancing was stiff and his stare didn't move, almost as if he did,
    a laser would shoot him in the back of the head. You try to get his attention,
    but no amount of arm waving or shouting in his face is helping. There's only one
    more thing left to try...\r\n\r\n1. Slap him across the face\r\n\r\n2. Stick your
    foot out and trip him"
