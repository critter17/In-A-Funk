  storyText: "The cone of light suddenly appears and you're somehow being lifted up
    in the air. The ceiling is sucking you up through the hole! Once you're through
    the hole, disco lights come on, and other people come into view. Their fingers
    are pointed up high and at an angle. You recognize that pose anywhere. The disco
    finger. But in perfect unison? No one dances that perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhat do you
    do?\r\n\r\n1. Look around for someone you know\r\n\r\n2. Join them, the Disco
    Finger is a better dance move anyway"
