  storyText: "You and the bartender take everyone's pins off and destroy them. It's
    now that you come face to face with the dancer abductors... Aliens. They look
    just like how they're described in the tabloids, which was surprising. They're
    green with two antenna looking ears and a ball at the end of each one. They don't
    look intimidating at all, in fact they look rather cute. However, they did kidnap
    your dancers at the hottest club in town.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Strangle
    them all to death\r\n\r\n2. Help them find their groove"
