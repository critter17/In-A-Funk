  storyText: "You go back to the Bus Stop dance but everyone is still not impressed.
    One guy approaches maybe too close for comfort and says, \"We don't like your
    kind around here.\" The bouncers come up behind you, pick you up, and throw you
    out of The Bus Stop. Feeling defeated, you wonder if it's worth continuing your
    search.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Continue your search at The Disco Finger\r\n\r\n2.
    Go home defeated and disappointed"
