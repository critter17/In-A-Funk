  storyText: You along with the other dancers decide to help the aliens how to move
    and they enjoyed it so much that they vowed not to destroy the planet. You're
    stunned for a moment thinking what could have happened if things went wrong, but
    you decide it's not worth worrying about and you DJ all night while in an alien
    spaceship, an experience that you will surely never forget. The creepy bartender
    is hitting on the girls as he usually attempts to do, and being on an alien spaceship
    wasn't going to change that.
