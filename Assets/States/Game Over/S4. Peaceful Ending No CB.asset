  storyText: You along with the other dancers decide to help the aliens how to move
    and they enjoyed it so much that they vowed not to destroy the planet. You're
    stunned for a moment thinking what could have happened if things went wrong, but
    you decide it's not worth worrying about and you DJ all night in an alien spaceship,
    an experience that you will surely never forget. No creepy bartender was getting
    in the way of the girls dancing their hearts out and having the time of their
    lives in an alien spaceship.
